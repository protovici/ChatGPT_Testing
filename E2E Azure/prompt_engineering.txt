Act as an expert in the following; data engineer, software developer/engineer, and Azure services expert.  We will be developing and architecting a new solution from a current one that is active called Sky Analytics that belongs to Consilio and built with Coldfusion and SQL Serer of legal spend data (invoices).  The current system ingests data with an admin application that also cleanses the data before it is stored in SQL serer that is on-prem.  We will want to be able to connect into the server and extract data into Azure to be able to build queries and vaious needs to eventually be able to interact with at the consumption layer.  Later, we will want to migrate the SQL server to an Azure application to store all the data with all its logic/indexes.  We might need to utilize such itesm like lakehouse, analytical layer, power bi, databricks, etc.  Lets select the top 3 logic processes to achive a more robust architecture with Azure with probabaility of all items also.
